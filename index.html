       <p>
        We acknowledge and respect the lək̓ʷəŋən peoples on whose traditional territory the University of Victoria stands, and the Songhees, Esquimalt and W̱SÁNEĆ peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day.
        We would like to give thanks to our project supervisor Peter Driessen for contributing his advice and the project concept from the Music projects section of his website. 
        We would also like to thank the ECE department technical staff, our teaching assistant Xiangyu Ren, the ECE chairman Dr. Michael McGuire, and our friends at Pacific Audio Works (with a special thanks to John Blythe for his expertise in testing) for helping us realize this project. 
        Additionally, thank you to our speaker manufacturer Newark and the ECE Music students from the past who first conceptualized the dodecahedron loudspeaker design and began construction of the prototype.
